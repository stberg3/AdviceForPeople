       "   'answer': '<p><strong>I have a lot of sympathy for anyone </strong>willing to admit they’re terrified of dying alone. But you should not have children. Raising a child for the sole purpose of creating a future nurse is no reason to start a family. Any child of yours would pretty quickly pick up on the fact that you find them exhausting, expensive, and a burden—things that are true of all children, but in your case would not be balanced by parental love. My guess is that child would not then leap at the chance to provide you with round-the-clock care in your declining years.</p><p>You must know on some level that having children does not guarantee anyone a peaceful death. Many people outlive their children. Many people with living, healthy children are still put into nursing homes for a variety of reasons. Having a child now is not insurance that you will be given the kind of death you want. Address your fear about end-of-life care directly by planning ahead. Establish a living will, start a retirement/medical fund that will help pay for private nursing, but don’t bring a child into the world just to alleviate your desire to avoid institutional care. Consider seeing a therapist to confront your (very normal!) concerns about your own mortality and what the end of your life may look like; you owe it to yourself to face these fears head on, rather than try to build a baby escape hatch and run away from them.</p>',\n",
       "   'question': '<p><strong>Dear Prudence, </strong><br>\\nMy husband and I have been married for three years. I am about to turn 30, and we are discussing the possibility of having children, although we are both leaning no. I have never felt a maternal need for kids, though I would love to have a dog. I have friends with children and while I love playing the part of auntie, I am exhausted after spending a day with them. When I think about kids, I mostly think about the negatives: They are expensive, we won’t be able to travel, and I have a family history of mental illness and some other diseases I would hate to pass down. There is one thing that keeps me from saying “no,” and that is that I am afraid of being alone when I am old and can’t fend for myself. I see my grandmother and have no idea what she would do if it weren’t for my mother and her siblings. I recently visited my old nanny in a state-run nursing home and it left me with nightmares. Should we have a child to make sure someone is there to care for us? Should we look into the Hemlock Society? I should add that I am generally not a strong person and have told my husband many times I pray that I die before he does.</p>'},\n",

I have always given him his space with stuff like this, but now I wonder if I need to draw some lines. With porn, at least I know he only does it in the home.

I don’t know if it’s worth having this fight while you’re on a road trip to see family—that’s definitely a varsity-level fight setting—but you can’t always choose where you host your battles. There’s nothing unusual about meeting an ex for afternoon coffee after a few years to catch up on each other’s lives. It’s clear from your letter you’re not harboring a secret affection for him or looking to exclude your partner; but you’re going to talk about your shared past and mutual friends, and there’s no real way for your current partner to be a part of this conversation.</p><p>If it’s not going to turn the rest of your trip into a grudge match, go have coffee with your ex. But if your partner truly can’t understand why you’d like to see your ex one on one without assuming it’s for underhanded reasons, I have a possible compromise. Since this is a road trip and your partner may not have anything else to do in the city, ask your partner to drop you off to meet with the ex for an hour, and then come by for the second hour to have less intimate (but still pleasant) small talk among the three of you. You and your ex get to catch up without having to constantly stop and explain things, and your partner gets to put a face to the Nameless Terror your ex represents.</p><p>(Also worth addressing at some point, if not now: Your partner wants to be an “indivisible” part of your life? That seems like an awfully high bar for togetherness. There’s nothing wrong with the occasional divisibility.)</p>',\n",

This ex and I parted ways about five years ago and haven’t stayed in touch since, but we were friends for a long time, and he was once a very important person in my life. I’d like to get coffee with him while I’m in town and catch up. The issue is that my partner says that if I meet up with my ex, I have to bring my partner with me, so my ex will understand I have someone who is “an indivisible part of my life now.” But I’m not looking to re-establish a friendship with my ex; I just want to get together once, and it would be strange and awkward if I brought my partner with me. Am I crazy to think that it should be permissible for me to meet up with this ex one on one in a public place for a couple of hours?

Casual hookup sites aren’t pornography. Cheating isn’t pornography. In this case, pornography is a red herring—your problem has very little to do with porn and a great deal to do with the level of trust and fidelity in your relationship.

We’ve watched it together a handful of times, but not consistently, and we don’t need it to have a great sex life. Recently I found out that he had visited sites for casual hookups in our area. When I confronted him, he apologized, said he’d been “curious,” and swore he didn’t hook up with anyone, but I am really struggling in dealing with what feels like a betrayal. He has cheated in the past. I found this out because he let me use his computer and he had emails from hookup sites for additional special offers. He has a history of avoiding confrontation and he feels pornography is not acceptable in society. He is in individual counseling to address this and other issues, and we are in couples counseling. Both of our counselors feel pornography is damaging—but would it help our situation?

There are no studies yet to establish that smoking or ingesting marijuana during pregnancy can result in damage to the child similar to Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, but neither has it been established as harmless. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with parents smoking weed responsibly, but I can’t encourage you to do so while pregnant.
